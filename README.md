# Hey, John hereðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a senior at the [University of Louisiana at Lafayette](https://louisiana.edu/) completing a degree in Computer Science and Cloud Computing. 

I originally started programming because I enjoyed video games. Afterwards, I started loving the complexity and the challenges of programming: solving problems and implementing the ideas.

I'm passionate about advancing my knowledge in the field and tackling new and difficult challenges. I especially enjoy it whenever I face a challenge that is applicable to the real-world. It itches a part of my brain.

Outside of school and work, I can often be found playing basketball (DISCLAIMER: I'm not good at all). Otherwise, I'm researching new things that interest me or playing Fortnite with my buddies.

I'm currently focused on developing my knowledge of AWS and delving into Machine Learning Models.
